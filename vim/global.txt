Multiple repeats

:[range]g[lobal]/{pattern}/[cmd]

    Execute the Ex command [cmd] (default ":p") on the
    lines within [range] where {pattern} matches.

g! 和 v 与之相反，操作剩下的行。上述 / 可以用其他一些字符替换。

To repeat a non-Ex command, you can use the ":normal" command: >
    :g/pat/normal {commands}
Make sure that {commands} ends with a whole command, otherwise Vim will wait
for you to type the rest of the command for each match.  The screen will not
have been updated, so you don't know what you are doing.  See |:normal|.

这两者是相同的

  :g/pattern/s//replace/g
  :%s/pattern/replace/g

这两者有区别

  :g/^$/d   # 删除空行
  :%s/^$//  # 不会发生变化
